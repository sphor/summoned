# Project Details

This project is built using Strapi as the backend, and Gatsby as the frontend. This repository contains both technologies so it will be a monorepo. 

## Instantiation
Create .env file and store League of Legends API key

## Express Server
Start express server:\
`node server.js`

Your Express server should now be running and listening for requests on http://localhost:3000. You can now make requests to your server to retrieve the last game played using the League of Legends API. Make sure to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) if your frontend is hosted on a different domain.
