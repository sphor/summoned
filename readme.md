# Project Details

This project is built using Strapi as the backend, and Gatsby as the frontend. This repository contains both technologies so it will be a monorepo. 

## Instantiation
Strapi API token was created (via backend) and stored in .env.development before frontend was run initially. 

## Running the Project Locally
Backend: `npm run --prefix backend develop`\
Runs on http://localhost:1337/admin

Frontend: `npm run --prefix frontend develop`\
Runs on http://localhost:8000/
